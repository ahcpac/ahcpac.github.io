Actions Have Consequences PAC
=================================

Actions Have Consequences Political Action Committee was formed
in response to the shameful events which occurred on January
6th, 2020. We are dedicated to the idea that despicable actions on the
part of elected leaders must have consequences, should they choose to
run for office again. We will raise money in order to place
advertisements in opposition to the the re-election of elected
official who we deem to have acted in a despicable way while
discharging their official duties. These include, but are not limited
to the 45th president of the united states, and the 8 senators and 139
representatives who voted to object to the certification of electors
in support of the fiction that there was rampant fraud in the 2020
election. These politicians are at best complicit in the incitement of
the seditious acts of January 6th, and we will work to ensure these
despicable actions against our republic have consequences at the
ballot box.
