{% include gallery layout="pinhead" id="traitors" caption="The 147 Republicans who voted to lie to American's about election fraud." %}

January 6th 2021 is a day that will live in infamy in American
history. It is the day that racist elements of our society, who would
have us return to the shameful dark days of American history marred by
the stain of Jim Crow laws and slavery, managed to fly the confederate
flag inside the capital building of our great nation; an act that was
never managed before, even during the civil war. Outrage is a natural
response to this travesty, and many questions remain to be answered
about how this came to pass, but what is clear to all people of good
conscience is that this shameful attack on our nations capital was
aided and abetted, nay incited, by the sitting president; not only
with words spoken online and at his embarrassing rally, but also by
how he wielded his power over law enforcement that day.

He was emboldened by those who wish to return us to the [election of
1876](https://www.history.com/news/reconstruction-1876-election-rutherford-hayes),
an election which tested the constitution and effectively ended
Reconstruction after the civil war, and gave room for the South to
create the Jim Crow laws, institutionalizing racism in America. An
election where Tilden, the Democrat, had won the popular vote by
260,000 votes, but only had 184 electoral votes, one shy of the number
needed to win. Returns from three states in the South (Louisiana,
Florida and South Carolina) were in dispute with both sides claiming
victory, and much like today there were arguments about voter
suppression. Modern Republican's have repeatedly claimed that there
were serious allegations of fraud, but have failed to bring any
evidence supporting those allegations in any of the more than 60 cases
they have brought in state courts, and even the United States Supreme
Court threw out the suits brought there before they even hit the desk,
and fraud which the William Bar, the since dismissed Attorney General,
a man who misled the public about the findings of the Muller
investigations to shield the president, stated he could find no
evidence of fraud. To resolve the dispute in 1876 an agreement was
made to create an electoral commission, just as the Republican's who
voted to dispute the electors requested. The truth is they hoped such
a commission could once again over rule the popular vote and the
electoral college, and overturn the results of the election in their
favor, while having no evidence that irregularities occured. It is
hard to see this as anything except an effort at voter suppression in
an attempt to maintain a racist, would be dictator's hold on power.

In 1876 Hayes had pledged to free the South of the influence of the
North, and so a deal was struck where Hayes would remove the Northern
troops and cede control of the South to the Democratic governments as
well as place a Southerner in his cabinet, and the Democrats agreed to
respect the civil rights of Black citizens, and allow the Republican
to take office anyway. The difference now is that the Republican party
wants a commission to overrule both the popular vote, and the certified
results of the electoral college in order to keep the sitting
president in power and allow them to continue to appoint judges who
will overturn laws which protect black voters, much as the Supreme
Court recently overturned provisions of the Voting Rights Act,
reducing federal interference in the South and allowing state
governments to once again make efforts to disenfranchise black voters.
The current effort to overturn the certified election results can only
be seen as a new effort to disenfranchise black voters.

In 1876 Hayes made good on his promise, but the Democrats did not
uphold their end of the deal. They moved quickly to reverse as many
Reconstruction policies as possible, leading to the shame of Jim Crow
laws, and the disenfranchisement of Black voters throughout the South,
often through intimidation and violence, which lasted until the civil
rights movement lead in part by Reverend Martin Luther King in the
1960s and John Lewis, who crossed a bridge in Selma 55 years ago in
order to vote; violence which in part lead to the Voting Rights Act.
The fact that the [memorial to John Lewis was
destroyed](https://twitter.com/LeaderHoyer/status/1347227669654630401)
in the attack on the capital is not a coincidence, it is a bold attack
on the equality people fought and died for in the Civil Rights
Movement. There is no small irony that the Supreme Court ruled in 2013
to eviscerate [Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act](https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act)
and southern states have since made multiple moves to further
disenfranchise black and minority voters under the guise of
"securing our elections".

The irony that the confederate flag was brought into our nations
capital, for the first time in American history, on the same day that
another [Reverend from Martin Luther King's church in Georgia](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/elections/2021/01/03/senate-race-shines-spotlight-on-ebenezer-baptist-black-americas-church) won a
seat in the Senate, a victory which gave the Democrats control of that
chamber, cannot be underestimated. The rise of the fanatical racist
right occurred in no small part as a backlash by racist factions of the
American public against the election of America's first black
president, emboldened by a candidate who rose to prominence in part
using racist dog whistles about Obama's birth certificate, and who had
a documented history of instituting racist policies in the operations
of his real-estate businesses, and who began his campaign with
racist rhetoric about Mexican immigrants. The fact is that Republicans
can only win elections through anti-democratic efforts to disenfranchise
voters, or through the tyranny of the minority enabled by the electoral
college, an institution created by the founders as a compromise way
to allow the south to hold more power than they rightfully should
in order to get them agree to the formation of The Union.

The reaction of the police to the white racially motivated terrorists
who vandalized and looted our nations capital only further highlights
the problem in America. Certainly this will be viewed as a terrorist
attack on America, and it is, and congress is very likely to pass new
laws aimed at domestic terrorism in the wake of these events, and will
ignore the fact that the existing laws would have been enough to
justify arresting the insurgents who attacked our capitals. The new
Draconian measures passed, much as The Patriot Act was passed post
9/11, will then be aimed squarely at Black Lives Matter and other
indigenous, sexual orientation, or environmental protesters, completely
ignoring the white supremacy problem these protesters represent. The
fact that there are videos online showing that once again the police
force was complicit, welcoming protesters in, and posing for selfies
with the police highlights that this is not an issue of terrorism,
this is an issue of racial bias driven by the legacy of slavery in
America. These protests make clear that Rage Against the Machine was
correct in saying ["Some of those who work forces, are the same that
burn
crosses"](https://genius.com/Rage-against-the-machine-killing-in-the-name-lyrics).
These protesters were emboldened not only by the rhetoric of the
president but also by the stance of our elected leaders, who stated
before the rally that they would be voting to object, a racist dog
whistle if there ever was one.

And there is no doubt that these people are racists. The photos posted
online have already identified members of the insurgents as [members
of right wing conspiracy groups like
QAnon](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-protester-capitol-antifa-qa/fact-check-man-with-painted-face-wearing-fur-and-horns-rallied-for-trump-and-qanon-not-antifa-or-blm-idUSKBN29C0BP),
and [Neo-Nazi
groups](https://nypost.com/2021/01/06/neo-nazis-among-protesters-who-stormed-us-capitol/),
and [The Proud Boys](https://www.bbc.com/news/55572805), and
[self-described White
Nationalists](https://www.thedailybeast.com/richard-barnett-man-pictured-at-pelosis-desk-is-self-described-white-nationalist).
Despite their rhetoric that this was antifa infiltrators, protesters
will continue to be identified as the days go by, and we are certain
that they will continue to be found associating with white supremacy
groups. Mary Miller, a Representative from Illinois, and one of the
members who voted to support the objections even [spoke at the rally
saying that "Hitler was
right"](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hitler-was-right-on-one-thing-republican-congresswoman-tells-pro-trump-rally/),
a wildly offensive remark aimed at encouraging at teaching children to
be racist.

{% include gallery layout="wide" id="allocation" caption="Allocation of Votes by State" %}

That 147 members of government would vote to support the lies
promulgated by the president about electoral fraud in the pursuit of
maintaining that racist president in power, especially after the
attack on the capital had already occured, is a direct attack on our
Democratic institutions, and is hard to see as anything but an
attempted coup. The fact that about half of those who voted for this
come from the South only serves to highlight the historical context in
which this occured. While racism is a problem nation wide the origin
has always been a problem of the South and the legacy of slavery. We
strongly believe that such actions cannot go without consequences. And
while it still remains to be seen if the vice-president will have the
courage to invoke the 25th amendment to remove our would-be-dictator
from office (spoiler alert: he won't) or that the legislative branch
will vote to impeach the president, remove him from office, and
prevent him from ever running again, (spoiler alert: the house will
impeach, but the senate will not convict), it is exceedingly unlikely
that *any* of the Senators or Representatives who voted in support of
the lies that lead to the violence will face consequences from their
peers, though the progressive arm of the Democratic caucus may try to
do so.

The United States also needs to remember the lessons of Nazi Germany,
in particular the ["Beer Hall
Putsch"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch), otherwise
known as Hitler's attempted coup in Germany in 1923, for which he was
tried and jailed. He was Chancellor of Germany just 10 years later,
and [consolidated power a year later to become supreme leader of
Germany](https://www.thoughtco.com/hitlers-rise-to-power-timeline-1221353).
Rest assured that these protesters would love nothing more than
installing a racist dictator in America. The fact that they flew flags
dedicated to a single man inside our nations capital sends a very
clear message about their intentions, and his dog whistle filled
request for peace video made absolutely clear that his intention is to
continue to fight for power once he is out of office. If he is not
impeached and prevented from running for office again, he will almost
surely do so in the future. Germany intentionally destroyed potential
monuments to Nazism such as the Spandau Prison, and yet their is
outrage in America over the removal of confederate monuments. Also
take note of Hitler's imposition of censorship in 1933, and the recent
push by the administration to [remove the Section 230 protections for
online
platforms](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-section-230-and-why-do-so-many-lawmakers-want-to-repeal-it/)
of the Communications Decency Act, which would allow for more
censorship of speech in this country. That we will convict him of high
crimes and misdemeanors by an evenly divided Senate, despite his
actual crime of inciting a violent attempt to overthrow our duly
elected government, is highly doubtful.

The only choice left is to defeat the scourge that is rising white
nationalism in America at the ballot box, so that our duly elected
leaders can alter the laws and fabric of America to bring social
justice. As a great man once said "the arc of the moral universe is
long, but it bends toward justice". Thus we have decided to start a
Super PAC dedicated to working to excise these racists from our
government using the democratic institutions that we have at our
disposal. The lesson of Stacy Abrams in Georgia this year is that if
we can raise money, and organize, and get candidates that black voters
can enthusiastically support on the ticket, we can defeat racists at
the ballot box. Because, while the Senator that Reverend Warnock will
replace, Kelly Laughler, didn't end up voting in support of the
president, she had announced that she would, and only recanted when
she saw that her support lead to violence. While we applaud her
courage to back away from supporting lies, her decision is tarnished
by the fact that she had already been voted out of office by the
people, and thus wasn't facing the possibility of losing the support
of the racist wing of the Republican party.

We believe it is high time to finish what the Hayes Compromise ended
prematurely, heed the lessons of Nazi Germany in dealing with these
white nationalists, and demonstrate that the actions of the President
and these Senators and Representatives have consequences. Only by
working together can we bring about needed change. We sincerely hope
that you will join our efforts to organize and advertise against these
bad actors in our government, so that we can forge a more perfect
union: one where racism is unacceptable.
