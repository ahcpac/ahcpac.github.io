Actions Have Consequences Political Action Committee was formed
January 7th, 2021 in response to the shameful attack on the capital of
the United States of America which occurred on January 6th, 2021. We
are dedicated to the idea that despicable actions on the part of
elected leaders must have consequences. We raise money in order to
place advertisements in opposition to the the re-election of any
elected official who we deem to have acted against our great republic
while discharging their official duties. These include, but are not
limited to the 45th president of the united states, and the 8 senators
and 139 representatives who voted to object to the certification of
electors. We believe that supporting the fiction that there was
rampant fraud in the 2020 election, despite a complete lack of
evidence is dangerous for our democracy and emboldens violent members
of our nation. These politicians are at best complicit in the
incitement of the seditious acts of January 6th, and we will work to
ensure that these, and any future despicable actions against our great
republic have consequences.
